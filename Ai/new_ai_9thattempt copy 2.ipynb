    "### Explanation of Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Resize Image:**\n",
    "   - `img = load_img(image_path, color_mode='grayscale', target_size=(128, 128))`\n",
    "     - Loads the image from `image_path` in grayscale mode and resizes it to a fixed size of 128x128 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert to Numpy Array:**\n",
    "   - `img = img_to_array(img).astype('uint8')`\n",
    "     - Converts the image to a numpy array of type `uint8`, which is suitable for processing with OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Gaussian Blur:**\n",
    "   - `blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (3, 3), 1)`\n",
    "     - Applies Gaussian blur with a kernel size of (3, 3) and a sigma of 1 to reduce noise in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Edge Detection (Canny):**\n",
    "   - `edges = cv2.Canny(blurred, threshold1=70, threshold2=100)`\n",
    "     - Detects edges using the Canny edge detection algorithm with thresholds set at 70 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dilate Edges:**\n",
    "   - `edges = cv2.dilate(edges, kernel, iterations=2)`\n",
    "     - Dilates the detected edges using a 2x2 kernel to thicken them for better feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Invert Edges:**\n",
    "   - `edges = cv2.bitwise_not(edges)`\n",
    "     - Inverts the edges so that detected edges are black and the background is white, which is often preferred for neural network input.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Normalize Image:**\n",
    "   - `edges = edges / 255.0`\n",
    "     - Normalizes the pixel values of the image to be between 0 and 1, which is typical for neural network inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Expand Dimension:**\n",
    "   - `edges = np.expand_dims(edges, axis=-1)`\n",
    "     - Adds a channel dimension to the image to make it suitable for feeding into a convolutional neural network (CNN), where `-1` signifies the last axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing function prepares the image for further feature extraction or directly as input to a CNN model for signature verification tasks."

    "### Explanation and Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate through Files in Folder:**\n",
    "   - `for filename in tqdm(os.listdir(folder)):`  \n",
    "     - Iterates through each file in the `folder` directory using `os.listdir()`. The `tqdm` wrapper is used to display a progress bar, which is helpful when processing a large number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check if File Exists:**\n",
    "   - `if os.path.isfile(img_path):`\n",
    "     - Ensures that `img_path` points to a file and not a directory. This check prevents errors that could occur if `filename` refers to a subdirectory or invalid path.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preprocess and Append Images:**\n",
    "   - `processed_img = preprocess_image(img_path)`\n",
    "     - Calls the `preprocess_image` function defined earlier to preprocess each image before appending it to the `images` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convert to Numpy Array:**\n",
    "   - `return np.array(images)`\n",
    "     - Converts the list of processed images into a numpy array before returning it. This conversion is typically necessary for compatibility with neural network frameworks like Keras or TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- Make sure `preprocess_image` function is defined before `load_images_from_folder` and correctly handles image preprocessing as per your requirements.\n",
    "- Consider handling exceptions that may arise during image loading or preprocessing to ensure robustness in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "- Adjust the function according to specific needs, such as adding error handling, logging, or modifying preprocessing steps.\n",

    "     - Initialize empty lists `X` to store images and `y` to store corresponding labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate through Person IDs:**\n",
    "   - `for person_id in range(1, 65):`\n",
    "     - Loop through each person ID from 1 to 64, assuming each person has a folder of genuine signatures (`person_id`) and a folder of forged signatures (`person_id_forg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Skip Specific Person IDs:**\n",
    "   - `if person_id in [5, 7, 8, 10, 11]: continue`\n",
    "     - Skip specific person IDs (5, 7, 8, 10, 11) as indicated in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Format Person ID:**\n",
    "   - `person_id_str = str(person_id).zfill(3)`\n",
    "     - Format the person ID as a 3-digit string (e.g., '001', '002') using `.zfill(3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Construct Paths to Signature Folders:**\n",
    "   - `real_folder = os.path.join(base_path, person_id_str)`\n",
    "     - Construct the path to the folder containing genuine signatures for the current person.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Load Images from Folders:**\n",
    "   - `real_images = load_images_from_folder(real_folder)`\n",
    "     - Load genuine signature images from `real_folder` using the `load_images_from_folder` function.\n",
    "   - `forge_images = load_images_from_folder(forge_folder)`\n",
    "     - Load forged signature images from `forge_folder` using the `load_images_from_folder` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Label Assignment:**\n",
    "   - For each image loaded:\n",
    "     - Append the image (`img`) to `X`.\n",
    "     - Append the corresponding label (`0` for genuine, `1` for forged) to `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Convert to Numpy Arrays:**\n",
    "   - `X = np.array(X)` and `y = np.array(y)`\n",
    "     - Convert lists `X` and `y` into numpy arrays for efficient handling in machine learning frameworks.\n",

    "   - `X = X.reshape(-1, 128, 128, 1)`\n",
    "     - Reshape the images for CNN input. Assuming images are grayscale and resized to 128x128 pixels, `-1` indicates that the first dimension (number of samples) is inferred based on the other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Return Dataset:**\n",

    "## Explanation with Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Squeeze and Excite Block (`squeeze_excite_block`):**\n",
    "   - Implements a squeeze and excite block, which enhances feature representation by focusing on important features and suppressing less relevant ones.\n",
    "   - `GlobalAveragePooling2D()` computes the average value for each channel across the spatial dimensions.\n",
    "   - `Reshape((1, 1, filters))(se)` reshapes the pooled features to prepare them for scaling.\n",
    "   - Two `Dense` layers with `relu` and `sigmoid` activations respectively adjust the importance of features across channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depthwise Separable Convolution Block (`depthwise_separable_conv_block`):**\n",
    "   - Utilizes depthwise separable convolution, which reduces computational cost and model size while maintaining performance.\n",
    "   - `DepthwiseConv2D` performs convolution independently over each channel of input, followed by a `Conv2D` for combining outputs.\n",
    "   - `BatchNormalization` ensures stable training by normalizing inputs to each layer.\n",
    "   - `squeeze_excite_block` enhances the feature representation learned by convolution layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Architecture (`build_smaller_model`):**\n",
    "   - Begins with a standard convolutional layer followed by batch normalization and max pooling.\n",
    "   - Sequentially applies multiple depthwise separable convolution blocks, each followed by max pooling to downsample feature maps.\n",
    "   - Concludes with global average pooling to reduce spatial dimensions while maintaining channel information.\n",
    "   - Includes dropout regularization to prevent overfitting and a final dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification (genuine vs. forged signatures).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimizer and Compilation:**\n",
    "   - Uses `AdamW` optimizer with a specified learning rate (`0.0001`).\n",
    "   - Compiles the model with binary cross-entropy loss (suitable for binary classification tasks) and accuracy metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Learning Rate Scheduler (`lr_schedule`):**\n",
    "   - Adjusts the learning rate during training epochs.\n",
    "   - Maintains the initial learning rate for the first 10 epochs and decays it exponentially thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Callbacks:**\n",
    "   - `LearningRateScheduler` is a callback that adjusts the learning rate according to the defined `lr_schedule` function during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Summary:**\n",
    "   - `model.summary()` prints a concise summary of the model architecture, displaying layer types, output shapes, and number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Input:** Ensure that input data (`X`) matches the expected shape (`input_shape`) defined in `build_smaller_model`.\n",
    "- **Training and Evaluation:** Implement the training loop using appropriate training data (`X_train, y_train`) and evaluation metrics to monitor model performance.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameters:** Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, dropout rate, and model depth based on validation performance.\n",
    "- **Deployment:** Consider requirements for deployment, such as model serialization (`model.save`) and inference implementation (`model.predict`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach to building and training the model ensures scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness in solving the signature verification task. Adjust the architecture and parameters based on specific data characteristics to achieve optimal results."

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training (`model.fit`):**\n",
    "   - `model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=50, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), callbacks=callbacks)`\n",
    "     - Trains the model on training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.\n",
    "     - Uses validation data (`X_test`, `y_test`) to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch.\n",
    "     - `callbacks` include the `LearningRateScheduler` defined earlier, which adjusts the learning rate during training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation (`model.evaluate`):**\n",
    "   - `test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)`\n",
    "     - Evaluates the trained model on the test data (`X_test`, `y_test`).\n",
    "     - Computes and returns the test loss (`test_loss`) and test accuracy (`test_acc`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Printing Test Accuracy:**\n",
    "   - `print(f\"Test Accuracy: {test_acc}\")`\n",
    "     - Prints the test accuracy after evaluating the model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preparation:** Ensure `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test` are properly prepared and normalized as required by the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Callbacks:** Adjust callbacks (`LearningRateScheduler`, etc.) based on training requirements and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameters:** Fine-tune hyperparameters such as batch size, epochs, learning rate, and model architecture based on validation results to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring Training Progress:** Utilize `history` object returned by `model.fit` to visualize training metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) over epochs for both training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Saving:** After training, consider saving the trained model (`model.save`) for future deployment or further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps and considerations, you can effectively train and evaluate your signature verification model, ensuring robustness and accuracy in detecting genuine and forged signatures. Adjustments and optimizations can be made iteratively based on validation performance and specific project requirements."
